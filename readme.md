## Derivative and Gradients

For a function f,

If derivative f' = constant value say, 4 or -1, then the function f increases ( or decreases 
constantly) at any point x of its domain.

If derivative f' = is a function then, it increases or decreases at different pace at different regions

## Probability

### Random Variables

	- Discrete
	- Continous


### Probability Mass Function

function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value


### Probability Density Function



The ```conditional probability Pr(X = x|Y = y)``` is the probability of the random variable X to
have a specific value x given that another random variable Y has a specific value of y. The
```Baye’s Theorem```.

Pr(X = x|Y = y) = Pr(Y = y|X = x) Pr(X = x)
						Pr(Y = y)

	1. Calculate z score using mean and standard deviation


z = (x – μ (mean)) / σ (standard deviation)

	2. Look in pdf table for probability mapping to z score 
	
	if needs prob of havin < x then use as is
	
	else if probability of occuring > x, then use
	
	1 - probability found in table
	

	
Gradient descent

We use natural log ...../because logarithm of a product becomes the sum of logarithms and it’s easier for the machine to
work with the sum than with a product.

Model based learning - e.g. SVM

Instance Based Learning -  kNN algorithm 

Shallow learning - manual features and modeling ML

Deep learning - NN modeling with more than 1 layer
